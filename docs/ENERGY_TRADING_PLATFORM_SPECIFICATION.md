# GridTokenX Energy Trading Platform - Integration Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the integration of advanced energy trading platform features with the existing GridTokenX blockchain infrastructure. The platform leverages the current Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture and extends it with smart contract-like functionality, dynamic pricing, and enhanced market mechanisms.

## 1. System Architecture Integration

The platform builds upon the existing three-layer architecture and DDD bounded contexts to separate concerns and ensure modularity.

### 1.0. Current DDD Architecture Foundation

**Shared Kernel**: Common infrastructure and domain components already implemented
- Domain events and error handling
- Command/Query buses for CQRS
- Repository patterns and aggregate roots
- Value objects and entity management

**Bounded Contexts**: Domain-specific modules
- Energy Trading (existing): Order management, trading engine, market operations
- Governance (planned): Incentive mechanisms, voting, staking
- Grid Management (planned): Physical layer integration

### 1.1. Physical Layer

**Hardware Requirements**: Integration with existing `GridManager` and real-time monitoring systems.

- **Smart Meters**: Real-time data integration via the existing grid monitoring infrastructure
- **Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)**: Solar PV, wind, and storage systems managed through `EnergySource` enumeration
- **Energy Storage Systems (BESS)**: Grid stabilization support through the existing grid physics simulation

### 1.2. Data & Communication Layer (Current Implementation)

- **Network**: P2P blockchain network with libp2p integration (existing)
- **Protocols**: Existing interoperable communication through the blockchain layer
- **Event System**: Domain events and integration events for real-time data flow

### 1.3. Transactional Layer (DDD)

- **Platform**: Existing blockchain infrastructure with DDD command/query separation
- **Core Logic**: Smart contract-like functionality through domain services and aggregates
- **Current Components**:
  - `EnergyOrder` entities with full lifecycle management
  - `OrderBook` aggregates for trade matching
  - `EnergyTrade` value objects for settlement
  - Command handlers for order placement and cancellation

## 2. Core Modules Integration (Smart Contract-like Services)

Building on the existing DDD energy trading domain, the platform enhances functionality through service-oriented smart contract simulation.

### 2.1. Market Engine: Enhanced Double Auction Service

**Current Implementation**: `OrderBook` aggregate with `EnergyTradingDomainService`

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Periodic Uniform-Price Double Auction (UPDA)**: Market clearing at 15-60 minute intervals
- **Existing Functions Enhanced**:
  - `place_order()` → Enhanced with auction scheduling
  - `process_order_matching()` → Upgraded to UPDA algorithm
  - Settlement through existing trade execution

**New Core Functions**:
```rust
// Extends existing EnergyTradingDomainService
impl EnergyTradingDomainService {
    pub async fn submit_bid(&self, quantity: f64, price: f64) -> Result<OrderId>
    pub async fn submit_ask(&self, quantity: f64, price: f64) -> Result<OrderId>
    pub async fn clear_market(&self, market_name: String) -> Result<Vec<EnergyTrade>>
    pub async fn settle_trades(&self, trades: Vec<EnergyTrade>) -> Result<()>
}
```

### 2.2. Dynamic Pricing Signal Service

**New Service**: `DynamicPricingService` to complement existing order book

**Objective**: Real-time price discovery integrated with current market depth calculations

**Algorithm**: Dynamic pricing formula based on supply-to-demand ratio
```
pt = (π/2) * pcon * tan⁻¹(k * ln(Rt)) + pbalance
```

**Integration with Current System**:
```rust
pub struct DynamicPricingService {
    order_books: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, OrderBook>>>,
    pricing_config: PricingConfig,
}

impl DynamicPricingService {
    pub async fn calculate_indicative_price(&self, market: &str) -> Result<f64>
    pub async fn get_supply_demand_ratio(&self, market: &str) -> Result<f64>
    pub async fn publish_price_signal(&self, market: &str, price: f64) -> Result<()>
}
```

### 2.3. Incentive Mechanism Service

**New Bounded Context**: `Governance` domain for token rewards and staking

**Integration**: Extends existing event system for reward distribution

**Rewardable Actions**:
- Energy Conservation: Monitor consumption patterns via grid events
- Demand Response: Price signal responsiveness tracking
- Liquidity Provision: Order book participation metrics

```rust
pub struct IncentiveMechanismService {
    pub async fn reward_conservation(&self, trader_id: TraderId, amount: f64) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn reward_demand_response(&self, trader_id: TraderId) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn reward_liquidity_provision(&self, trader_id: TraderId) -> Result<()>
}
```

### 2.4. Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Marketplace

**New Aggregate**: `RECToken` with marketplace functionality

**Integration**: Extends existing energy source tracking in `EnergyOrder`

**Functionality**:
- Automatic REC minting for verified renewable energy
- Secondary marketplace for environmental attributes
- Lifecycle management with retirement tracking

```rust
pub struct RECMarketplaceService {
    pub async fn mint_rec(&self, energy_amount: f64, source: EnergySource) -> Result<RECToken>
    pub async fn list_rec_for_sale(&self, rec_id: RECId, price: f64) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn retire_rec(&self, rec_id: RECId) -> Result<()>
}
```

## 3. Technology Stack & Enhanced Deployment Strategy

### Current Foundation
- **Rust 2021**: Existing async/await infrastructure
- **Blockchain**: Current P2P network with libp2p
- **Storage**: RocksDB with existing `StorageManager`
- **DDD**: Command/Query buses, event-driven architecture

### Phase 1: Enhanced Pilot (Building on Current System)

**Blockchain**: Enhance existing private network capabilities
- Extend current PoA consensus for energy market operations
- Integrate smart contract-like services through domain services
- Add auction scheduling and settlement automation

### Phase 2: Production Scaling

**Primary Path**: Evolve current Rust infrastructure
- Scale existing P2P network for higher throughput
- Implement state channels for high-frequency trading
- Add cross-chain bridges for external settlement

**Alternative Path**: Smart contract deployment
- Port domain logic to Solana/Ethereum contracts
- Maintain existing DDD structure as business logic layer
- Use blockchain for final settlement and audit trail

## 4. Enhanced Tokenomics (Integrated with Current System)

### 4.1. Governance & Staking Token (NRG) - New Domain

**Integration**: New `Governance` bounded context

```rust
pub struct GovernanceToken {
    pub symbol: String, // "NRG"
    pub total_supply: u64, // 1 billion tokens
    pub circulating_supply: u64,
}

pub struct StakingService {
    pub async fn stake_tokens(&self, amount: u64) -> Result<StakePosition>
    pub async fn vote_on_proposal(&self, proposal_id: String) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn claim_rewards(&self) -> Result<u64>
}
```

### 4.2. Stable Credit Token (SparkTHB) - Enhanced Current System

**Enhancement**: Integrate with existing energy transaction settlement

```rust
// Enhance existing EnergyTrade settlement
pub struct StableCreditService {
    pub async fn purchase_credits(&self, fiat_amount: f64) -> Result<u64>
    pub async fn settle_energy_trade(&self, trade: &EnergyTrade) -> Result<()>
    pub async fn redeem_to_fiat(&self, credit_amount: u64) -> Result<f64>
}
```
