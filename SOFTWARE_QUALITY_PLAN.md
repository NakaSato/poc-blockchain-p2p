## Code Quality Framework

### 1. Rust Best Practices

#### Code Style Standards
```rust
// Use consistent naming conventions
pub struct GridTokenXNode {
    blockchain: Arc<RwLock<Blockchain>>,
    config: NodeConfig,
}

// Implement proper error handling
pub async fn process_transaction(
    &self, 
    tx: Transaction
) -> Result<TransactionReceipt, ProcessingError> {
    // Implementation with comprehensive error handling
}

// Use comprehensive documentation
/// Processes energy trading transactions on the GridTokenX blockchain
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `transaction` - The energy trading transaction to process
/// * `authority` - The authority submitting the transaction
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(TransactionReceipt)` - Success with transaction receipt
/// * `Err(ProcessingError)` - Processing failure with detailed error
```

#### Code Organization
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns into distinct modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined public APIs
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error types and handling patterns

### 2. Architecture Quality

#### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces

#### Current Architecture Assessment
```
✅ Strengths:
- Modular blockchain components
- Async/await throughout
- Clear separation of consensus, storage, and networking

⚠️  Areas for Improvement:
- API module compilation issues
- P2P network behavior implementation
- Error handling consistency
- Interface abstractions
```

        let result = validate_transaction(&tx).await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_energy_trading_logic() {
        // Test core energy trading business logic
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]

async fn test_multi_node_blockchain() {
    // Test full blockchain with multiple authorities
    let nodes = setup_test_network(4).await;
    let result = execute_cross_authority_transaction(&nodes).await;
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_api_endpoints() {
    // Test REST API functionality
    let server = start_test_api_server().await;
    let response = submit_test_transaction(&server).await;
    assert_eq!(response.status(), 200);
}
```

#### End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)
```bash
# Test complete energy trading workflow
./test-scripts/e2e-energy-trading.sh

## Documentation Quality

### 1. Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation
```rust
/// Represents an energy trading transaction on the GridTokenX blockchain
/// 
/// This struct encapsulates all information needed for peer-to-peer energy trading
/// between authorities in the Thai electricity market.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// use gridtokenx_blockchain::EnergyTransaction;
/// 
/// let energy_tx = EnergyTransaction::new(
///     500.0,  // energy_amount (kWh)
///     "solar", // energy_type
///     5,      // price_per_kwh (tokens)
/// )?;
/// ```
/// 
/// # Security Considerations
/// 
/// - All transactions must be cryptographically signed
/// - Energy amounts are validated against physical constraints
/// - Price manipulation is prevented through market mechanisms
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct EnergyTransaction {
    /// Amount of energy being traded in kWh
    pub energy_amount: f64,
    /// Type of energy source (solar, wind, hydro, etc.)
