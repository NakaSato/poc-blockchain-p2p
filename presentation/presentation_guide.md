## 🔧 Technical Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers:

**Q: How does it handle grid congestion?**
A: Real-time monitoring rejects trades during congestion, and pricing adjustments incentivize off-peak usage.

**Q: What about regulatory compliance?**
A: Authority nodes from EGAT, MEA, PEA provide final validation for large trades, ensuring full compliance.

**Q: How secure is the hybrid consensus?**
A: PoS prevents nothing-at-stake attacks, PoW secures energy transactions, and authority nodes provide regulatory oversight.

**Q: Can it scale to national level?**
A: Yes, auto-scaling supports 1-8 shards (8,000 TPS), with geographic sharding across Thailand's regions.

**Q: What about transaction costs?**
A: Minimal fees (1 token minimum), much lower than traditional energy trading intermediaries.

**Q: How do you ensure energy delivery?**
A: IoT integration tracks actual delivery, with smart contracts handling settlement and penalties.
